# Lecture materials

Here are materials for the code-part of the lecture on digitalization at the National Library of Norway.

## [HTR Demo](./HTR_demo.ipynb)

This notebook shows an example of handwritten text recognition (HTR) and some benefits of fine-tuning models for your own applications.
First, we explore a pretrained model for Norwegian historic handwritten letters.
The handwritten text we use here is taken from the [NorHand-v3-line](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Teklia/NorHand-v3-line)-dataset from Huggingface (which is a processed version of the [NorHand v3](https://zenodo.org/records/10255840) dataset from Zenodo.)
